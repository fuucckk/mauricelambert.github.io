<h1>OPERATION BRIEFING</h1>

<div class="scenario-box">
  <p><strong>K41r0</strong> is a well-known name in the underground world of ethical hacking. An enigma, a ghost, and a silent guardian, he has never asked for payment or recognition. His mission has always been clear: defend freedom, protect the vulnerable, and fight against the exploitation of women and children. He's been involved in high-stakes investigations across the globe, often assisting intelligence agencies under the radar.</p>

  <p>Recently, K41r0 played a critical role in identifying and tracking a notorious gang involved in the trafficking and exploitation of children. The group was on Interpol’s public watchlist, but until his intervention, had always remained a few steps ahead. Through months of quiet investigation, infiltration, and digital surveillance, the net began to tighten — especially around a gang member known only as <strong>"Venom"</strong>.</p>

  <p>But the mission went wrong. During his digital pursuit of Venom, K41r0 was compromised. His identity was exposed. Knowing full well the danger this posed not only to himself, but to those around him, he made the only choice he could — disappear. He fled the country, abandoned his former identity, and assumed a new one. But his fight is far from over. Even from the shadows, he intends to continue his work for justice.</p>

  <p>Before leaving, he entrusted a hand-written note to trusted intelligence contacts. It contained his final instructions. He made it clear that he had permanently deleted the encryption mechanism that would otherwise keep sensitive data locked away for years. However, he also ensured that smart agents would be able to access and secure the data — if they were clever enough.</p>

  <p><strong>You</strong> are those agents. Your task is to locate, access, and secure the sensitive data before it falls into the wrong hands. But that is not the end. K41r0 left you with a final warning — a final challenge that goes beyond simply opening a file.</p>

  <div class="footer-quote">
    <em>"You'll need to be observant to find the first object you'll need — look for anything that seems out of place, something that doesn’t quite belong where it is... After that, you'll have to be clever enough to retrieve what matters without moving the object itself. You'll need to be clever to access the data, but once you do, your mission isn't over. You'll have to secure it... and then replicate a part of my investigation to uncover gang members still hidden in the shadows."</em>
